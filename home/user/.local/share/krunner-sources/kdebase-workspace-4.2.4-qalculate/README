This is a stripped down version of the kde4.2.4-workspace build environment
meant for building the qalculate runner.

krunner_qalculate requires qalc (from libqalculate) to be in $PATH.  
Qalculate can be acquired at: 

To build the qalculate runner run

> cmake .
> cd plasma/runners/qalculator
> make

To install, copy the krunner_qalculatorrunner.so from the kdebase-workspace-4.2.4-qalculate/lib 
to your kde4 lib directory. For example

> cp ../../../lib/krunner_qalculatorrunner.so /usr/lib/kde/

and finally, copy the plasma-runner-qalculator.desktop file to the kde4 services folder.
For example

> cp plasma-runner-qalculator.desktop /usr/share/kde4/services/

Qalculate results should appear next time you run krunner :-).
