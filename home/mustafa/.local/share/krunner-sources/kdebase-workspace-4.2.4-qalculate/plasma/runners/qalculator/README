*** ABOUT ***

qalculatorrunner adds support for doing mathematical computations
via qalculate in krunner.  The functionality is very similar to
the default calculator runner.

Qalculate offers arbitrary precision calculations and will solve
certain algebraic equations.  It also offers symbolic computation
for exact results--a large improvement over the default calculator
runner.

*** INSTALL ***

Before you build qalculatorrunner, you must have the qalc program from 
libqalculate in $PATH.

To build the qalculate runner, go to the root kdebase-workspace-4.2.4-qalculate
folder and run

> cmake .
> cd plasma/runners/qalculator
> make

To install, copy the krunner_qalculatorrunner.so from the 
kdebase-workspace-4.2.4-qalculate/lib to your kde4 lib directory. For example

> cp ../../../lib/krunner_qalculatorrunner.so /usr/lib/kde/

and finally, copy the plasma-runner-qalculator.desktop file to the kde4 services 
folder.  For example

> cp plasma-runner-qalculator.desktop /usr/share/kde4/services/

Qalculate results should appear next time you run krunner :-).

*** DOC ***

qalculatorrunner invokes the qalc command from libqalculate for all expressions
involving an '=' character.  Two results are returned, one that is always
approximated in decimal and one that is always in exact form.  qalc is called
with 100 places of percision, though only 26 are shown.
